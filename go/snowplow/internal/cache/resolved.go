// resolved.go — Tag 0.30.7 binding: in-process L1 resolved-output cache
// (bounded LRU + byte-budget + time-to-live only).
//
// Per implementation plan §"Tag 0.30.7 — What's implemented":
//
//   - Bounded LRU over `(restaction_path|widget_path, user_identity,
//     query_hash)`. Entry count cap (default 100 000) AND byte-budget
//     cap (default 2 GB). Eviction is single least-recently-used — no
//     complex sweep machinery (Q-L1-BUDGET / audit guidance).
//   - Invalidation in this sub-ship: time-to-live only. DELETE-driven
//     invalidation lands at 0.30.8 per feedback_l1_invalidation_delete_only.md.
//
// Layering rule (project_redis_removal.md): the cache subsystem stays
// removable via CACHE_ENABLED. When `Disabled()` is true the resolver
// cache is never instantiated; dispatchers take the exact 0.30.6 path.
// Even with CACHE_ENABLED=true, RESOLVED_CACHE_ENABLED=false bypasses
// the L1 layer while keeping the rest of cache=on alive (typed-RBAC
// indexer, informer factory, EvaluateRBAC gate).
//
// Sub-ship A (0.30.7) does NOT add:
//   - DELETE-driven eviction (0.30.8).
//   - Dependency tracking (0.30.8).
//   - Refresher (0.30.8).
//   - Per-class queueing (0.30.11).
// Per the plan, none of these are sneaked in here.

// entries never serve as v4 (per-binding-keyed) hits.
//
// Additionally, the v3-v4 fold also drops the apistage exclusion: under
// v3 the apistage cell was identity-free at the ComputeKey level (the
// per-cohort gate-memo filtered items at serve time); under v4 the
// apistage cell folds BindingUID like every other identity-bound class.
// The cohort-gate-memo apparatus is deleted (design §3.4). Pre-v4
// apistage entries CANNOT serve as v4 hits even under the same identity
// because the v3 key did not encode identity.
// Ship #118 (c) — BUMPED v4 → v5. ComputeKey now folds RBACSubGen (the
// requesting identity's per-subject RBAC sub-generation) alongside BindingUID
// for every identity-bound class. A pre-v5 cell's key did not encode the
// sub-gen, so it is structurally different from a v5 key for the SAME access;
// the salt rotation forces a clean rolling key break — no pre-fix (RBAC-blind)
// entry serves as a post-fix hit across the restart (C-118-7).
//
// Ship #118 (c)-v2 — BUMPED v5 → v6. The RBACSubGen FIELD SHAPE is unchanged
// (still uint64), but its TIMELINE changed: (c) v1 (v5) bumped the sub-gen
// SYNCHRONOUSLY on the RBAC delta event; (c)-v2 defers the bump to
// snapshot-publish (rbac_subgen_pending.go, GAP-2). For a subject mid-
// transition at the rolling-restart boundary, the SAME logical access can map
// to a different sub-gen under the two regimes → a v5 cell could be served as
// a v6 hit and re-pin the very staleness this fix removes. The salt rotation
// forces every pod to treat pre-v6 cells as non-hits — a clean cross-regime
// break, identical rationale to v3→v4 and v4→v5.

// fallthrough_meter.go — Ship D (0.30.141, architectural-consistency
// invariant). Layer A of the design (§3 of
// docs/ship-d-architectural-consistency-design.md).
//
// PURPOSE — invariant-lock, not wall-clock. Every `/call` read path in
// cache=on mode MUST be cache-served; this file provides the MECHANISM
// (a closed-enum-labelled counter + sampled WARN) that surfaces any
// future regression where a request takes the apiserver-fall-through
// lane. NO BEHAVIOUR CHANGE — `RecordApiserverFallthrough` is a
// telemetry-only call invoked at the construction sites listed in the
// 1.12.4 design §5.2; it never short-circuits, redirects, or modifies
// an upstream request.
//
// 1.12.4 — TWO FAMILIES, TWO MAPS (design §5). The counter's own
// definition is "a `/call`-class read that caused snowplow to issue a
// request to the live Kubernetes apiserver". Six of the 21 reasons
// contradict that in their own doc-comments (resolver-plurals-hit is
// an in-process cache HIT; resolver-plurals-miss double-counts the hop
// already counted by plurals-discovery-hop; widget-content-hit and
// widget-content-miss-per-user-fallback are L1 serves;
// cluster-list-dispatch records a SUCCESSFUL collapse). On the krateo-057
// corpus they were 828,525 of the 936,320 headline count — 88.5% of the
// number an operator reads as "the cache is not serving".
//
// Those six now land on a SEPARATE counter and a SEPARATE cell map
// (`snowplow_cache_diagnostic_total` / `_cells`). Two maps, not one map
// with two scalar totals: the acceptance requirement is that
// `resolver-plurals-hit` is ABSENT from the fallthrough cells map, which
// a shared map cannot satisfy. Membership of `diagnosticReasons` is the
// ONLY thing that routes a Record* call, so a call site cannot mis-route
// a reason.
//
// CARDINALITY DISCIPLINE — PM-tight. The labels are closed enums:
//
//   - `reason` — the 16 FallthroughReason* constants below. New reasons
//     MUST be added here as named constants; ad-hoc strings are
//     forbidden (defence-in-depth on Prometheus cardinality budget).
//   - `path`  — the scope name passed to FallthroughScopeMiddleware,
//     bounded by the dispatcher's route list (call-restactions,
//     call-widgets, call-generic, call-write-*, list, plurals,
//     nested-call, resolver-inner-call) — 7-10 values.
//   - `gvr`   — bounded by the cluster's GVR set (~50 at production
//     scale); empty string when the apiserver call has no GVR (e.g.
//     `endpoints.FromSecret` is a Secret read but the wrapper is
//     called at the resolver mapper stage where the resolver's
//     target GVR is unknown — use `""` to keep cardinality bounded).
//
// Worst-case cardinality: 10 × 50 × 16 = 8000 series. Well within
// Prometheus comfort. The counter is exposed via `expvar` in
// fallthrough_meter_expvar.go — same pattern as snowplow's other
// metric counters (informer_dispatch_metrics.go).
//
// CACHE-TOGGLE COMPLIANCE (project_caching_is_provisional + AC-D.1).
// `RecordApiserverFallthrough` short-circuits when `cache.Disabled() ==
// true` — in cache=off mode the apiserver hops are the documented
// upstream baseline (project_caching_is_provisional), the counter
// stays silent. The middleware-driven scope marker is also short-
// circuited (see fallthrough_ctx.go).

//     now uses cache.KindForGVR which records
//     ReasonResolverPluralsHit/Miss.
//   - ReasonRestmapperResourceFor — `dynamic.ResourceFor` deleted;

//
// Ship D.4 / 0.30.144 (HARD-REVERTED) introduced
// ReasonApistagePartialShape and a TypeMeta-based predicate at the

// → false positives across `namespaces`, `configmaps`, etc.
// The constant and both gates were removed in Ship D.4.1.
//
// Ship D.4.1 / 0.30.145 (HARD-REVERTED) introduced a per-stage

// burst evidence showed `tmp_is_nil=false` on every fire — the

// ("apistage-get-partial-shape"). EMPIRICALLY GROUNDED at the
// 0.30.148 burst's site=13 evidence: 10/250 served objects for
// `/v1, Resource=configmaps` had `obj["apiVersion"] == nil` (key
// ABSENT from the map). Fired by gateGetEnvelope:281's narrower
// Go-nil-check predicate (NOT D.4's TypeMeta string-zero-value
// check) on per-name GET-by-name cached envelopes whose decoded
// map lacks `apiVersion` or `kind`. The defect flows: apiserver
// elides per-item TypeMeta on core-group LIST responses (k8s
// convention) → streaming_list.go captures item bytes verbatim →
// bytesObject's b.raw lacks apiVersion → dispatchViaInformer's
// json.Marshal produces bytes without apiVersion → apistage Put
// stores them → apistage Get + gateGetEnvelope decodes back →
// obj["apiVersion"] is Go nil (untyped nil from absent map key).
// Returns (nil, false) → fall-through to fresh apiserver GET-by-
// name (the existing served=false arm). Distinct name from D.4's
// reverted ReasonApistagePartialShape — `-get-` suffix signals
// the narrower scope (GET-by-name only, NOT LIST), avoids bisect

//   - ReasonClusterListShapeFallback — fires when AC-D5.14's defensive
//     multi-element shape check rejects the cluster-scope response
//     envelope (missing list kind, empty/missing items, items lacking
//     apiVersion/kind). The dispatcher then falls back to the per-NS

// ResetFallthroughCountersForTest zeros every per-cell counter and the

// at internal/rbac/evaluate.go:48.
//
// 1.12.4 (design §5.4, gate condition C5): the diagnostic map and total
// MUST be reset here too. Without it, F5's exact-conservation arm
// (FallthroughTotal()+DiagnosticTotal() == N) inherits counts from an
// earlier arm in the same test binary and flakes.
//
// 1.12.4 also changes this from ZEROING cells to DELETING them. The old
// behaviour left every key resident with a 0 count, which is invisible
// to FallthroughCount (0 either way) but NOT to anything that counts
// CELLS — and the cardinality-cap falsifier does exactly that. An arm
// that pushes the map past the cap and asserts "cap + 1 overflow series"
// was off by however many keys earlier arms had left behind. Deleting is
// the honest meaning of "reset" and is what makes a cell-count assertion
// deterministic across arms in one binary.

// The load-bearing property here is NOT "the map has the right keys". It
// is that reading the telemetry surface does not CONSTRUCT the thing
// being measured. ResolvedCache() lazily builds the store, wires the dep
// tracker and starts the summary goroutine; if the expvar closure went
// through it, then scraping /debug/vars on a pod where L1 had never been
// touched would create an L1 cache and a background goroutine. That is a
// side effect no observability surface may have, and it is exactly the
// mistake the obvious implementation makes.

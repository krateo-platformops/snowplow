// fallthrough_split_test.go — 1.12.4 falsifiers F4 + F5 for the
// fall-through / cache-diagnostic two-map split (design §5.4).
//
// WHAT THESE ARMS ACTUALLY DRIVE. Both call the REAL exported entry
// point `RecordApiserverFallthrough` (and the two thin wrappers
// `RecordResolverPluralsHit` / `RecordResolverPluralsMiss` that the 27
// production sites use) under a REAL `WithFallthroughScope` context.
// Nothing is stubbed and no seam is installed: the routing decision
// under test lives in `RecordApiserverFallthrough` itself and the
// counting in `recordCell`, and both execute here exactly as they do on
// a `/call`. A temporary `panic()` at the top of `recordCell` fails
// every arm below, which is the proof that the production frame runs.
//
// [C4] CACHE_ENABLED. `Disabled()` reads the env LIVE and DEFAULTS TO
// DISABLED, so without `t.Setenv("CACHE_ENABLED","true")` every
// `Record*` call is a silent no-op and these arms would pass for the
// wrong reason — a green that means "the recorder was switched off",
// not "the routing is correct".
//
// [C5] IMPOSSIBLE-BASELINE SENTINEL. A bare `uint64` 0 cannot tell
// "nothing was recorded" apart from "the recorder is inert", because a
// no-op produces the same 0. Every arm therefore opens through
// `probeTotals`, which returns the impossible sentinel -1 when either
// no-op condition of `recordCell` holds (cache disabled, or the ctx
// carries no active scope). Reading 0 from `probeTotals` is a positive
// statement that the recorder is LIVE and empty.

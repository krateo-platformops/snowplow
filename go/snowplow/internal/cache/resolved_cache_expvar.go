// resolved_cache_expvar.go — 1.12.4 §7b. expvar exposure for the L1
// resolved-output store's occupancy and lifetime counters.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every field below already exists on
// ResolvedCacheStats and is already computed by Stats(). Until now the
// ONLY place it went was the periodic `resolved_cache.summary` INFO line
// emitted by startResolvedCacheSummary — and the chart ships
// LOG_LEVEL=warn, which suppresses INFO entirely. So in production the
// numbers that say whether the L1 cache is full, thrashing, or evicting
// were computed every N seconds and then thrown away. This publishes
// them on the surface that is actually readable (/debug/vars, and via
// the OTLP mirror in internal/metrics).
//
// SHAPE. One expvar key, `snowplow_resolved_cache`, returning a
// map[string]int64 keyed by stat name — the same "one counter keyed by
// stat" idiom the OTLP mirror already uses for snowplow_refresher and
// snowplow_crd_discovery, so the two surfaces map 1:1 with no per-stat
// key sprawl at /debug/vars.
//
// NON-CONSTRUCTING. The closure reads resolvedCachePublished (an
// atomic.Pointer written inside resolvedCacheOnce), NOT ResolvedCache(),
// which would lazily build the store, wire the dep tracker and start the
// summary goroutine. A telemetry scrape must never create the thing it
// is measuring. Before the store is built the closure returns an empty
// map rather than zeros, so "not built yet" and "built and empty" are
// distinguishable.
//
// COST. Stats() takes the store's full exclusive mutex (resolved.go
// Stats), not an RLock, and the body is order.Len() plus a handful of
// field reads — microseconds. startResolvedCacheSummary already calls it
// on a timer, so this is not a new class of contention; it is the same
// call on two more read paths. Noted deliberately and NOT "fixed" in
// this release (design §7b / gate §C).
//
// CFG-1 (cache-off compliance, project_cache_off_is_transparent_fallback).
// Under CACHE_ENABLED=false there is no L1 store, so the key MUST NOT be
// registered at all — not registered-with-zeros. The gate is at init()
// time, matching fallthrough_meter_expvar.go, and
// RegisterResolvedCacheExpvarForTest is the sync.Once-guarded seam for
// tests that flip CACHE_ENABLED with t.Setenv after init() already ran.

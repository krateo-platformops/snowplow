// a1_uaf_widget_sites_test.go — R-1 per-site arms for the two remaining widget
// carriers: the BOOT SEED (seedOneWidget) and the identity-free WIDGETCONTENT
// populate (populateWidgetContentL1).
//
// The R-2 acceptance arm covers the customer dispatch. These two cover the paths
// that fill the same cells WITHOUT a customer request — and they matter more than
// the dispatch on a cold pod, because they warm a per-BINDING cell under a cohort
// REPRESENTATIVE identity (the seed) or an identity-FREE shared cell under the
// SA identity (the walker). Both are read by every co-bound user's first paint.
//
// Each arm pairs the refiltered case with a non-refiltered CONTROL that must
// still be cached, so a gate that simply disabled the widget seed or the content
// layer wholesale cannot pass.

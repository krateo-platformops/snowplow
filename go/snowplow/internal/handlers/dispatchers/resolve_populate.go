// resolve_populate.go — Ship C (0.30.112): the single resolve-and-store
// path for the L1 resolved-output cache.
//
// resolveAndPopulateL1 re-resolves an L1 entry from its own
// ResolvedKeyInputs and writes the fresh bytes back under the canonical
// key. It is the body the runtime refresher's RefreshFunc invokes on a
// dirty-mark (Ship C) and the body Ship F's prewarm will reuse — one
// resolve path, no duplication.
//
// IDENTITY (PM directive, AC-C7): the re-resolve runs under the entry's
// OWN Inputs identity — Username + Groups from the ResolvedKeyInputs.
// A refresh of user U's entry resolves as U, so RBAC narrowing and the
// resolved content stay user-correct. The re-resolve context also carries
// WithL1KeyContext(key) so the resolver re-records dep edges (the inner
// object set may have changed since the original resolve).
//
// SA TRANSPORT (Ship 0.30.113 Part B): a background refresh has no live
// per-user bearer token — the original request's Endpoint is long gone.
// The widget resolver (widgets.Resolve) reads xcontext.UserConfig(ctx)
// directly and fails "user *Endpoint not found in context" if only the
// identity (WithUserInfo) is supplied. With the informer pivot ON
// (#57: implicit-on-cache, i.e. the cache subsystem on) every K8s read
// is informer-served and
// RBAC-narrowed IN-PROCESS from WithUserInfo — never from the user's
// token — so the user's Endpoint is needed ONLY as a transport. We
// therefore supply the snowplow ServiceAccount endpoint + *rest.Config
// as that transport (WithUserConfig + WithInternalEndpoint +
// WithInternalRESTConfig) while keeping WithUserInfo{Username,Groups}
// for per-user correctness. No per-user token is stored. This is the
// EXACT pattern Phase 1 uses (withPhase1SAContext, phase1_walk.go) — the
// load-bearing 0.30.103 SA-CA seam. When saEP/saRC are nil (no SA creds
// — unit test / outside-cluster) the context is identity-only as before.
//
// Per feedback_l1_invalidation_delete_only.md: this path only ever
// Put()s — it never evicts. A refresh that lands after the entry was
// evicted must not resurrect it (see the post-resolve liveness re-check).

		// 1.12.5 / #187 (i) — PRESERVE the 404. Pre-1.12.5 every re-fetch
		// error was flattened to a string here, so resolveAndPopulateL1
		// could not tell "this CR was deleted" from "the apiserver hiccuped"
		// and treated both as retryable: five requeues, then refresh_dropped
		// with the stale body still resident until the 1h TTL. Wrapping the
		// definite 404 in errSelfObjectGone lets the caller EVICT instead.
		//
		// TWO BOUNDS, both load-bearing:
		//
		//  - ONLY a definite 404. A 403 (RBAC blip), a 500, a timeout and a
		//    parse failure all keep today's requeue — an apiserver hiccup
		//    must never evict a slice of L1 at once.
		//  - NEVER the informer-only miss. Under cache.WithInformerOnlyReads
		//    objects.Get SYNTHESISES a NotFound rather than reaching the
		//    apiserver (objects/get.go informerOnlyMiss), so its 404 means
		//    "not in the indexer", not "deleted from the cluster". That is
		//    precisely the transient a CRD re-registration produces, and it
		//    must stay retryable.
		//
		// Every other 404 here HAS been confirmed by the apiserver: the
		// informer branch falls through to a live GET on a miss.
		//
		//  - ONLY while the TYPE still exists. Architect Finding 1: the two
		//    bounds above are not enough. When a CRD is absent — deleted and
		//    recreated, which is exactly what a portal release does — the
		//    apiserver returns a GENUINE 404 for EVERY object of that GVR.
		//    apierrors.IsNotFound is true and the context is not informer-only,
		//    so without this conjunct every refresh of every entry of that GVR
		//    would evict on first touch: a cold-cache storm at 50K, and
		//    precisely the transient the bound exists to prevent. It is not a
		//    correctness bug — the entries re-resolve on the next dispatch —
		//    but it is the wrong shape at production scale.
		//
		//    IsRegistered, deliberately, NOT IsServable/confirmed: those ride
		//    the 30s discovery tick (servable.go RefreshDiscovery) and would
		//    mis-time the window. IsRegistered is structurally tied to the CRD
		//    lifecycle — triggerCRDDelete → RemoveResourceType → not registered
		//    → no eviction. During a SCHEMA RELIST the GVR is re-registered
		//    immediately (crd_discovery_side_effect.go), so an object genuinely
		//    deleted inside that window still evicts, which is what the
		//    post-sync re-fire depends on.
		//
		//    A nil global watcher means the type cannot be confirmed at all, so
		//    it reads as "do not evict" — the same conservative direction
		//    isSelfRepresentation takes when it cannot classify.

// phase1_pip_seed.go — Ship PIP (0.30.173): the per-identity prewarm
// seed of restactions + widgets top-level L1.
//
// FOLDED 2026-07-03 (docs/prewarm-engine-implicit-on-cache-2026-07-03.md §4):
// the LEGACY orchestration in this file — runPIPSeed (the GOMAXPROCS errgroup
// cohort fan-out), seedCohort, seedCohortFn, enumerateAggregatePrewarmTargets
// (+Fn) — is DELETED. The prewarm engine is now implicit-on-cache and its
// engine seed (prewarm_engine_boot.go seedScopeYielding) is the ONLY seed path;
// the errgroup back-out lever (PREWARM_ENGINE_ENABLED=false) that kept the
// legacy path alive is retired. This file is now the SHARED SEED-PRIMITIVE
// LIBRARY: seedOneRestaction / seedOneWidget / seedRAFullListForWidget /
// withCohortSeedContext / cohortLogLabel + the navWidgetHarvester type — all
// called by the engine boot seed. The seedTarget type + PrewarmPIPEnabled gate
// also live here.
//
// THE NORTH-STAR DEFECT THIS SHIPS AGAINST (unchanged rationale). After
// phase1Done=true at 0.30.172, admin's first compositions-list /call was
// l1_hit:"miss" (~13.8 s) — the per-USER resolved-output L1 (top-level
// restactions / widgets cache classes) was cold for every cohort. The seed
// primitives here fill that gap: BEFORE phase1Done flips, the engine seed warms
// the top-level L1 once per (per-binding target, restaction) AND once per
// (target, widget) reached by the Phase-1 walker, so the first /call returns
// l1_hit:"hit" with zero resolve.
//
// PER-BINDING TARGETS. The seed target set is derived from the BindingsByGVR
// reverse index via cache.EnumeratePrewarmTargetsForGVR (per navigated GVR),
// built by the engine boot re-walk — see prewarm_engine_boot.go.
//
// MEMORY BOUND (fold 2026-07-03). Each seed unit funnels through the ADAPTIVE
// seed-unit gate (enterSeedUnit, seed_bound.go) — serialize against live
// GOMEMLIMIT headroom, per-unit calibration, AssertSeedUnitFootprint diagnostic.
// This is the ONLY thing bounding seedRAFullListForWidget's unpaginated
// full-list (the #23 dominant allocation); the adaptive nested-resolve bound
// does NOT cover it (§3.1).
//
// CONCURRENCY (architect's design §3). The cohort loop runs under a
// bounded errgroup with limit = runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0) — matches the F2
// content-warm's bounded fan-out shape. Each cohort's seed is
// SEQUENTIAL inside the goroutine: it iterates the harvested
// (restaction, widget) sets one at a time. The bound on transient RSS
// per cohort is N_restactions×envelope_bytes + N_widgets×envelope_bytes
// — same OOM profile as the F2 content pass per cohort.
//
// PER-COHORT TIMEOUT (restored 0.30.191 SCOPE CORRECTION). Set via
// context.WithTimeout inside the per-cohort closure. A stuck cohort
// thus cannot wedge Phase 1 past Step 7.6's global budget; the timeout
// firing returns ctx.Err() up the errgroup which propagates as the
// cohort's seed-failure path. The 0.30.190 proportional-timeout model
// (computeCohortTimeout) was REVERTED at 0.30.191: it was an INFERENCE
// from a file header comment ("1.5s/widget × 132 widgets = 198s"), not
// a measurement. Per feedback_data_driven_workflow +
// feedback_empirical_root_cause_trace_before_fix we are NOT raising the
// ceiling until 0.30.191 instrumentation tells us which abort cause
// actually fires for the 0.30.189 sentinel cohort. The 120s fixed
// ceiling is the 0.30.179 value.
//
// FEEDBACK_CHECK_K8S_CLIENTGO_PRIOR_ART: client-go has no equivalent
// for per-RBAC-cohort prewarm. RBAC subject enum is a custom snowplow
// concern (no upstream evaluator exists in client-go; rbac/v1
// authorizer evaluates one request at a time). PIP's cohort
// enumeration is therefore a custom mechanism.
//
// FEEDBACK_NO_SPECIAL_CASES: no hardcoded admin / hardcoded user / no
// resource-name literals. The cohort list is derived purely from the
// published RBAC snapshot; the restaction set is the same harvester
// the F2 content pass drains; the widget set is the new
// navWidgetHarvester populated by the existing walk. Every identifier
// flows from the cluster state, not from Go literals.
//
// FEEDBACK_RESTACTION_NO_WIDGET_LOGIC + FEEDBACK_L1_PER_USER_KEYED_
// NEVER_COHORT: PIP keys every L1 entry per-user via the dispatcher's
// canonical dispatchCacheLookupKey (helpers.go) under a ctx whose
// xcontext.UserInfo carries the cohort's Username + Groups. No cohort
// cross-leak path exists — the cache layer SEES per-user keys; PIP just
// pre-populates one entry per cohort.

	// resolved or evicted reads them, and nothing here participates in the
	// dedupe or the removal policy — `entries` is the harvested set and stays
	// the only thing the seed drains.
	//
	// WHY THEY EXIST. `entries` is a monotonic cumulative UNION by deliberate
	// design (see forgetCoordinate: remove on positive evidence only, never on
	// absence, because the walk is lossy). A coverage collapse is therefore
	// UNREACHABLE against it — measuring the union answers "what has this pod

	// reach". These sets carry that second measure and nothing else.
	//
	// KEYED BY COORDINATE (gvr|ns|name) — deliberately NOT by the entry key,
	// which carries the pagination tuple. The same widget reached under two
	// tuples is ONE reached widget; the coordinate is also the unit
	// forgetCoordinate removes by, so the set difference subtracts like for
	// like.
	//
	//   passReached    — coordinates THIS pass reached. CLEARED at the top of
	//                    every walking pass (BeginWalk).

	//   forgottenPass  — coordinates dropped by an authoritative GONE verdict
	//                    in the current generation.
	//   forgottenPrev  — the same for the preceding generation.
	//
	// ── TWO CLOCKS IS THE BUG THIS SHAPE EXISTS TO AVOID. The baseline and the
	// forget generations roll at the COMPLETED EVALUATION, never at the pass
	// boundary — coveragePassSnapshotAndPromote, called once from
	// recordWalkCoverage after `lost` has been computed, promotes BOTH in the
	// SAME mu hold that read them. Rolling either one at BeginWalk instead puts
	// it on a different clock from the evaluation, and both halves of that are
	// live defects:
	//
	//   - roll prevReached at the boundary and a benign PARTIAL pass becomes the
	//     baseline. Partial passes are routine (the F.4 resume path exists
	//     because deadline cuts happen) and a collapse whose root stopped
	//     resolving FIRST MANIFESTS as a partial, so the arrival order
	//     completed(177) → partial(5) → completed(5) is the likely one, not an
	//     exotic one. The real collapse then compares equal and is SILENT.
	//   - roll only the reach and leave the forgets on the pass clock (or vice
	//     versa) and a forget falls out of the discount window while its widget
	//     is still in prevReached, turning an ordinary delete into a FALSE
	//     ALARM — strictly worse than the missed detection above. Move both or
	//     neither.
	//
	// ── forgottenPrev IS NOT A TOLERANCE. It is two generations because `prev`
	// is captured DURING a pass: a widget deleted mid-pass, AFTER that pass had
	// already reached it, has its forget consumed at that pass's evaluation
	// without being needed (the widget was still in `reached`). The loss
	// surfaces at the NEXT evaluation — after the promote drops it from
	// `reached` but while it is still in `prevReached` — and with a ~255 s walk
	// that ordering is the COMMON one, not the corner. A forget must therefore
	// survive exactly one evaluation to be available when `prev` is compared.
	// Collapse these two into one set and every ordinary delete of a widget
	// removed mid-pass raises a false alarm.
	//
	// ── THE REJECTED ALTERNATIVE, AND THE TRAP IN IT. A single accumulating
	// forget set can be made to work, but ONLY with BOTH of its rules: drain it
	// by INTERSECTING it with the new baseline (never an unconditional clear),
	// AND remove a coordinate from it when the coordinate is re-harvested.
	// Three reviewers independently reached for the wrong form — one set,
	// unconditional clear — which is precisely the shape that reintroduces the
	// mid-pass-delete false alarm described above. Two generations rolled at the
	// evaluation is the form that does not depend on getting both of those rules
	// right. If you are about to simplify this to one set, that is the step you

//     they lazy-expire while dedup'ing churny/fresh cells (recovering F.4's
//     cost-proportional chunk resume for keepwarm with zero cycle-tracking
//     state).
//   - seedModeGVRDiscovered: NEVER skip. gvr-discovered must RE-RESOLVE
//     already-warm cells so the dep edge against the newly-registered GVR is
//     recorded (the S4 fix; F4-C3 boundary).

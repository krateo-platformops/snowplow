// ra_full_list.go — Ship 4a (0.30.198): the page-independent RAFullList
// serve path at the apiRef chokepoint.
//
// THE CHOKEPOINT. Every widget→RESTAction read funnels through
// apiref.Resolve (resolve.go), which resolves the RA at the request's
// PerPage/Page and returns the RA's Status map. Today each page re-resolves
// the whole RA (62-namespace fan-out + 49K sort + deep-copy + gojq
// recompile) because nothing caches the RA result page-independently. Ship
// 4a caches the RA's FULL result ONCE per (RA × cohort × non-slice extras)
// resolved UNPAGINATED, and serves each page as a cheap Go-slice over that
// one cached array.
//
// PER-/CALL SLICEABILITY VERDICT (design §3). On first sight of a
// (RAFullList-key × sliceShape) we byte-VERIFY: the Go-slice over the
// freshly-resolved full F must byte-match a fresh page-keyed resolve, AND
// the full F itself must byte-match a fresh unpaginated resolve. Match →
// memo sliceable, serve the Go-slice. Differ → memo NOT-sliceable for THIS
// shape → fall back to the page-keyed resolve forever (never a wrong
// result). The verdict is process-local; re-evaluated per new shape + on
// pod restart.
//
// REMOVABILITY (project_caching_is_provisional): this file + the single
// branch in resolve.go + the cache-package resident region are the entire
// 4a surface — wholesale-deletable. Gated under cache.ResolvedCacheEnabled()
// (CACHE_ENABLED); flag-off it is never entered.

	// the EMPTY cell — freezing the fast path on an empty result FOREVER (it
	// never re-verifies). But an empty full is INDISTINGUISHABLE from a
	// not-yet-synced / continueOnError-degraded resolve (panels informer not
	// synced at boot → panel LISTs degrade to []), so it is NOT an
	// authoritative sliceable verdict. Refuse to record OR Put: leave the
	// verdict UNKNOWN so the NEXT request re-runs first-sight once the
	// informer is synced (self-healing), and serve the (correct, empty)
	// page-keyed S_ra meanwhile.
	//
	// PERF: this guard adds ZERO resolves — `full` is ALREADY resolved on
	// this first-sight path for the byte-verify, so the emptiness check is
	// free. We never RecordSliceability on empty, so the cheap fast path
	// (known&&sliceable → Get → GoSlice) is never entered for an empty cell;
	// every request stays on first-sight only while the full resolves EMPTY
	// (cheap — a not-synced fan-out yields []), NOT a 48s/163MB full. The
	// one-time expensive full resolve happens exactly once, AFTER sync, when

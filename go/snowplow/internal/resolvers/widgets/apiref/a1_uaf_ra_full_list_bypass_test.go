// a1_uaf_ra_full_list_bypass_test.go — 1.12.3 A-1 arm (e): the raFullList
// sibling of the restactions Put-decline.
//
// THE DEFECT HERE IS THE SAME SHAPE, WITH FEWER DEFENCES. raFullListServe
// caches the apiRef'd RESTAction's FULL resolve output — userAccessFilter stage
// included — under a cell keyed by seedFullListRAKey, which folds the RA-CR's
// first-match BindingUID ALONE (no RBACSubGen, unlike the restactions key). So
// two co-bound users with divergent per-object narrowings land on ONE cell and
// the second is served the first one's rows as a Go-slice.
//
// THE MITIGATION is a BYPASS rather than a Put-decline, because this path has
// both a serve side and a populate side and they share one entry point: a
// UAF-bearing RA returns served=false before the key is even derived, and
// apiref.Resolve falls through to the page-keyed resolve under the request's own
// identity — the function's ESTABLISHED fall-back contract, the same exit the
// not-sliceable and no-identity cases take.
//
// WHAT THIS ARM PINS, and why each assertion is here:
//   - served=false, so the caller re-resolves per request (the leak is closed);
//   - ZERO resolves are consumed by this path (it bails before the first-sight
//     double resolve) — proving the bypass is early, not a late discard;
//   - NO cell under the derived raKey (the populate side is unreachable);
//   - NO sliceability verdict recorded for the shape — a verdict is keyed by
//     (raKey × shape) and would let a LATER caller take the fast path;
//   - the bypass counter ticks;
//   - and a non-UAF CONTROL still verifies, Puts and serves, so a bypass that
//     had simply disabled the 4a layer wholesale cannot pass.
//
// RED on origin/main: served=true, the cell is Put, the verdict is recorded, and
// the counter does not exist.

# snowplow — architecture

The single canonical map of snowplow. Everything else hangs off this file; the deep dives under
[`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/) trace each subsystem through the code.

> **Read this as a map, not the territory.** Every claim here is traced to the deep dives, which are
> traced to the current tree. If a deep dive and this page disagree, the deep dive (and the code it
> cites) wins — fix this page.

## What snowplow is

A **content bridge**: it resolves `RESTAction` and frontend `Widget` custom resources into the JSON
the Krateo frontend renders, served over **`/call`**. It is not a BFF and holds no product state —
it composes content on demand from Kubernetes CRs and serves it to whatever client (the SPA, or
`curl`) reads it. Server wiring and routes live in `main.go`: the content routes (`GET/POST/PUT/
PATCH/DELETE /call`, `GET /list`, `GET /export`, `GET /api-info/names`, `POST /jq`, `GET /rbac`),
the per-subject live-refresh SSE stream (`GET /refreshes`), the probes (`/health`, `/readyz`), and
the debug surface (`/debug/vars`, `/debug/pprof/*`, `/debug/servable`, `/debug/apistage`,
`/debug/refreshes`, `/swagger/`). The `/debug/*` block is registered by
`registerDebugRoutes` (`debug_routes.go`), and since 1.12.3 every route in it requires a JWT;
the probes stay anonymous.

## The request path (→ [request-lifecycle.md](docs/architecture/request-lifecycle.md))

```
GET /call ─▶ Dispatcher middleware ─▶ dispatcher (restactions | widgets) ─▶ resolve
            (internal/handlers/proxy.go)   (internal/handlers/dispatchers/)   (internal/resolvers/)
                                                    │
                                       RBAC gate + serve-time filter ─▶ serialize ─▶ write
```

- **GET** verbs flow through the `Dispatcher` middleware (`internal/handlers/proxy.go`) into a
  resolver. **Write** verbs bypass dispatch entirely and are a raw apiserver passthrough
  (`internal/handlers/call.go`) — never resolved, never cached.
- **Resolver layering contract (invariant):** a `RESTAction` emits *unordered* data; the *widget*
  canonicalizes and shapes it. RESTAction carries **no widget-shaping logic**. Equivalence is
  asserted at widget props.

## The three-tier cache (→ [caching.md](docs/architecture/caching.md))

```
L3 informer cache  ─▶  L1 resolved-entry cache  ─▶  dispatcher cache
(internal/cache/watcher.go)   (internal/cache/resolved.go)   (internal/handlers/dispatchers/)
```

- A widget has **two** L1 keys: an **identity-free content key** (`dispatchWidgetContentKey`,
  username/groups zeroed) and an **identity-bound key** that folds the **first-match RBAC
  `BindingUID`** *plus* the identity's **per-subject RBAC sub-generation** (`RBACSubGen`)
  (`dispatchCacheLookupKey` → `rbac.EvaluateRBAC` + `cache.RBACSubGenForSubject`). Keys are a
  versioned SHA-256 (`resolved.go ComputeKey`, `resolvedKeyVersion="v6"`).
  > **Correction over older docs/notes:** the identity-bound key is **per-binding-UID**, *not*
  > "per-cohort". The pre-`v4` per-cohort `BindingSetHash` was replaced by per-binding `BindingUID`;
  > `v5`/`v6` added the RBAC sub-generation fold so a grant/revoke touching a user's own bindings
  > cold-misses that user's cells. Per-binding sharing is the equivalence class that still
  > satisfies "never cohort-only" (below).
- Request `extras` partition the key only on two author-declared axes: the widget's
  `spec.keyExtras` allowlist and the `spec.identityContext` identity keys (username/groups);
  undeclared request extras never fork a cell (an undeclared-extras resolve is served but not
  cached).
- **Invalidation:** `DELETE` evicts only the deleted object's own self-representation; LIST-deps and
  dependent GET-deps are dirty-marked; `ADD`/`UPDATE` dirty-mark (never evict). Values are
  deduplicated by equivalence class. A resolve that touched a genuine **external** endpoint is
  never cached (no dep edge can invalidate it) unless the widget opts into a bounded-staleness TTL
  via the `krateo.io/external-cache-ttl-seconds` annotation.

## Prewarm (→ [prewarm.md](docs/architecture/prewarm.md))

- Boot seed (`RegisterMetaQuerySeeds`) + a **phase-1 walker that replays frontend navigation**:
  roots are read from the frontend ConfigMap (the `.api.INIT` / `.api.ROUTES_LOADER` `/call` URLs,
  decoded to ObjectReferences and fetched by name — the root KIND is whatever the ConfigMap says,
  never hardcoded), recursing `status.resourcesRefs` **only where `verb==GET`**.
  The seed itself is the 5 meta-query anchors (`restactions` + 4 RBAC); the legacy `navmenus` /
  `routesloaders` anchors were removed in #483 along with both kinds.
- Cohort model is **dynamic** — no static cohort list, no lazy cold-fill. The seed is rank-major
  (widget-capable identities first) and class-interleaved (each rank's widgets then its
  RESTActions).
- **The prewarm engine is the only seed path and is implicit-on-cache**: the whole prewarm family
  (`PREWARM_ENABLED`, `PREWARM_CONTENT_ENABLED`, `PREWARM_PIP_ENABLED`, `PREWARM_ENGINE_ENABLED`,
  `PROACTIVE_RA_SEED_ENABLED`) is **retired** into `CACHE_ENABLED` (`retired_flags.go` audits stale
  values); the legacy global-cohort `runPIPSeed` path is **deleted**. Back-out is
  `CACHE_ENABLED=false`.
- **`/readyz` gates on prewarm-complete**: the seed runs *before* `MarkPhase1Done`; readiness flips
  when every cohort's nav widgets are warm (the first-nav latch), with fire-regardless backstops
  (Ready-degraded, never not-Ready-forever). Steady-state re-prewarm is object CRUD → refresher
  re-resolve, new-GVR → engine re-walk, and a TTL-cadenced keepwarm sweep; widget-CR-triggered
  subtree re-walk is still a **placeholder**.

## RBAC & user-aware filtering (→ [rbac-uaf.md](docs/architecture/rbac-uaf.md))

- L1 is **keyed per binding-UID (plus the subject's RBAC sub-generation), never cohort-only** —
  this is the load-bearing invariant (a 6-revert retrospective); cohort-only keying leaks one
  user's resources to another.
- An **RBAC subject index** (`internal/cache/rbac_snapshot.go`) selects candidate bindings;
  `EvaluateRBAC` walks ClusterRoleBindings then RoleBindings with **predicate symmetry** across
  User / Group / ServiceAccount subjects.
- **Serve-time UAF:** results are re-filtered against the requesting user at serve time (multiple
  sites in resolvers/objects/dispatchers), not trusted from the cache alone.

## North-star (→ [north-star.md](docs/architecture/north-star.md))

- **Aspirational contract:** 1s cold / 500ms warm / 1s fresh at 50K compositions × 1000 users.
- **Measured as real Chrome page-load** (`e2e/bench/.../browser.py` `waterfallMs` over `/call`
  resource entries), **mix-weighted 0.95 narrow-RBAC + 0.05 admin** (`ledger.py`) — NOT `curl` p50.
- **Enforced gate today is 2200ms cold / 1000ms warm / 30000ms fresh** (`ledger.py` tier constants),
  relaxed-on-proof: server compute is sub-millisecond; the residual is SPA fan-out (frontend-scoped).
  The 1s/500ms figure is the goal, not the current gate.

## The provisionality invariant (load-bearing)

All caching is **provisional and cleanly removable**. `CACHE_ENABLED=false`
(`internal/cache/cache.go` `Disabled()`) is a **transparent fallback** to the direct apiserver —
same data, same UI, same RBAC, just slower — not a degraded mode. Caching must never constrain the
RESTAction/widget contract, and must be removable wholesale when Kubernetes ships better caching.

## For agents

The Krateo `snowplow-agent` grounds in these docs at the **deployed version's tag** — see
[`docs/llms.txt`](docs/llms.txt) for the index and the version-pinned retrieval procedure. The
deployment/CRD/wiring view lives in this same repo: the Helm charts under
[`helm/`](../../helm/snowplow/) and the standard doc bundle at the repo root
([`docs/`](../../docs/index.md)); this directory's docs are the internals/runtime view.

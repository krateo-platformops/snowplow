"""Playwright driver — login, navigation, validation, convergence poll,
video recording.

The harness uses Playwright exclusively (no Chrome MCP); video → GIF
post-processing via ffmpeg. NEVER uses kubectl-mediated paths in scored
measurement (see feedback_no_kubectl_in_measurement.md).

Per docs/bench-restructure-path-b-plan-2026-06-02.md §A.5 (Block 3).

      - At large N (S6 with 50K comps) > per_page=5 comp-panels exist
        → datagrid caps at 5 → actual=30 = 10+4×5.

    Probe B in the Phase 6 S8/S9 two-probe inner gate. Hits the same

    path the dashboard piechart uses; isolates 'snowplow's evaluator
    serves the right narrowed view' from 'snowplow's RBAC snapshot was
    rebuilt' (Probe A reads the expvar).

    Re-gate v3 (2026-06-05): renamed mechanism. The pre-v3 implementation
    hit `cluster.call_url(ns)` which constructs a /call URL WITHOUT a
    `name=` parameter. Snowplow's /call requires `name=` for composition
    GVR reads (TRACED: HTTP 400 "missing 'name' query parameter" for
    both admin AND cj at the diag capture
    `/tmp/diag-cj-rbac-probe-2026-06-05.log`). The -1 sentinel masked
    the URL bug, NOT RBAC.

    The piechart-widget endpoint returns `status.widgetData.title` as
    the user-narrowed composition count (UAF per JWT). Symmetric
    admin/cj: admin gets cluster-wide total; cj gets the sum across
    granted namespaces. For the bench's single-ns-grant pattern this
    equals comps_in_ns; for multi-ns grants it sums.

    The `ns` argument is retained for API stability + log correlation
    but is NOT threaded into the URL — the piechart RESTAction does
    its own RBAC narrowing per token. Callers may still pass it for
    diagnostic record-keeping.

    Args:
        user:  subject string (metadata only — token carries identity).
        token: bearer JWT for the user.
        ns:    namespace label (NOT used in URL — see above).

    Returns:

#      logs every USER in before any stage runs.
#
# There is deliberately NO lazy login here: _debug_auth_headers sits on the
# probe path and must stay I/O-free and side-effect-free (the unit tests drive
# it with urlopen mocked and no cluster). A probe-only invocation that never
# called login_all sets SNOWPLOW_DEBUG_TOKEN, or calls set_debug_token().
#
# Any authenticated identity works: the gate validates the JWT signature and
# does not authorize per-key, so the counters an operator sees are the ones the

    The waterfall measurement only tells us when network activity stopped.
    It does not tell us whether the dashboard actually rendered piechart
    + table or whether every widget is still showing a Skeleton because
    the stability poll exited prematurely. This helper applies three
    gates and returns a structured result dict; callers decide whether
    to invalidate `waterfallMs` based on `terminal_state`.

    Gates:
      1. widget-scoped .ant-skeleton count == 0 — HARD FAIL.
      2. .ant-result-error count is recorded but NOT a failure: errored
         widgets are a valid terminal state. The count IS still
         load-bearing in S8/S9 `__passed__` per Task #250 R4 mitigation —
         the stage runner reads `errored_count` from the proof and
         requires `== 0` for the cj/Compositions cell.
      3. /call count must be within EXPECTED_CALLS_TOLERANCE of
         expected_calls(user, page_path, n_visible=N) — HARD FAIL on
         deviation. The N-aware formula (Task #250 Block 2) adds the
         per-card-widget fan-out term for /compositions when the user
         has visible cards; admin reads cluster-truth, cj reads the
         RBAC-narrowed piechart count (parametric per
         feedback_no_special_cases).

    Args:
        page:      Playwright Page object.
        page_path: page URL path used for EXPECTED_CALLS lookup.
        label:     diagnostic label for log lines.
        user:      subject the page is logged in as (drives n_visible
                   sourcing).
        token:     optional bearer JWT for the same user; used to query
                   the per-user composition count when narrowing applies.
                   When None and the user is non-admin, falls back to
                   BASE expected (the legacy pre-Block-2 behaviour).

    Returns a dict with keys:

    `verify_against_cluster` controls the S6 piechart convergence check.
    For admin (cluster-wide RBAC) the piechart value must converge to
    the cluster's total composition count; for cyberjoker (RBAC scoped
    to a single namespace) the piechart will legitimately show fewer,
    so we fall back to an intra-user UI-vs-API consistency check
    (api_count == ui_count).

    On VERIFY-poll deadline expiry with `matched=False`, this function
    RAISES `ConvergenceTimeout(stage, user, api, ui, cluster, timeout_secs)`
    rather than silently logging TIMEOUT/MISMATCH (worktree source
    6465-6475's silent-skip bug). Block 4's stage runner catches it,
    persists a stage proof with passed=False + convergence_timeout=true,
    then re-raises to abort the run with exit 4.

    `page_slots` (Task #267 FIX 2 + #307 ArchLazyDash + #310b — film both
    pages, lazily): ONE slot map {page_name: slot} the recording path passes
    (the same map `phases._open_stage_recording_pages` returns). Each `slot`
    is a dict carrying BOTH the routing sentinel and the shadow factory that
    used to live in the parallel `pages_by_name` / `page_factories` dicts:

      slot["page"] — the routing sentinel: None means "lazy, no live page
                     yet" (route into the factory); a live page object means
                     "measure on this page directly".
      slot["make"] — a zero-arg factory invoked at ITS page's loop iteration
                     below; it creates that page's dedicated recording
                     BrowserContext (Playwright records exactly one .webm per
                     context) and writes the materialised page back into the
                     SAME slot — so the dashboard context's video contains
                     only dashboard navs and the compositions context's only
                     compositions navs, and neither context (nor its video
                     clock) exists before its own nav.

    When `page_slots` is None (every unit test's no-video path) OR a given
    page_name has no slot, the single `page` argument is used for that
    page_name, exactly as before. The VERIFY/convergence/content block runs
    in the Dashboard branch on the materialised page, so its logic is
    untouched. #310b collapsed the prior two parallel dicts (pages_by_name +
    page_factories, keyed identically by page_name) into this one slot map —
    same routing + lazy-materialise semantics, one structure.

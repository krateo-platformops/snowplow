# Configuration

Everything is driven by the `snowplow` Helm chart
([`helm/snowplow/values.yaml`](../helm/snowplow/values.yaml)). The authoritative
machine-readable surface is
[`helm/snowplow/values.schema.json`](../helm/snowplow/values.schema.json) — every value
below is typed and validated there; this page explains, it does not re-enumerate.

## The env contract

The container takes **no direct `env:` array**. Every value that reaches the process
goes through `envFrom` ([`deployment.yaml`](../helm/snowplow/templates/deployment.yaml)):

1. the chart-managed `snowplow` ConfigMap — rendered from `.Values.env`;
2. a small `env:` array for the JWKS knobs (`jwt.*` below) — no key material, just
   the URL and cache tuning;
3. `extraEnvFrom` — by default the optional `snowplow-api-override` ConfigMap, so the
   portal blueprint can layer config without re-templating this chart.

**No key Secret is mounted.** snowplow verifies RS256 JWTs against authn's public key
fetched from authn's JWKS endpoint (`/.well-known/jwks.json`), so it holds no copy of
the key: rotating authn's keypair needs no snowplow redeploy and there is no
public-key Secret to keep in sync. The key set is fetched **lazily on the first token
validation, not at startup** — snowplow starts and serves its unauthenticated routes
even when authn is not up yet, and recovers by itself once authn answers. While the
key set cannot be fetched, authenticated requests get `503` (retryable), not `401`.

A `checksum/configmap` pod annotation rolls the Deployment when the ConfigMap changes.

## Helm values (top level)

| Value | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `image.registry` / `image.repository` | `ghcr.io` / `krateo-platformops/snowplow` | The app image. `global.imageRegistry` relocates the registry host for mirror/air-gapped installs (repository path preserved). |
| `image.tag` | `""` (= chart `appVersion`) | Pin only to diverge from the released pairing. |
| `service.type` / `service.port` | `LoadBalancer` / `8081` | One port serves everything: content, probes, debug. |
| `replicaCount` | `1` | With `autoscaling.enabled: false` (default). |
| `strategy` | `RollingUpdate`, `maxSurge: 1`, `maxUnavailable: 0` | Zero-gap deploys: the new pod prewarms behind `/readyz` while the old warm pod keeps serving. |
| `progressDeadlineSeconds` | `1200` | Rollout deadline; must exceed informer sync + prewarm seed at scale. |
| `resources` | limits `4 cpu / 8Gi`, requests `2 cpu / 4Gi` | Pre-sized for 50K compositions × 1000 users (informer + in-process L1 cache). |
| `startupProbe` / `livenessProbe` | `/health`, widened thresholds | `/health` binds early and never gates prewarm; liveness must not kill a warming pod. |
| `readinessProbe` | `/readyz` | Flips 503→200 on **prewarm-complete**, not mere informer sync. |
| `ingress` | `enabled: false` | Standard chart ingress if you need it. |
| `jwt.jwksUrl` | `""` (derives from `URL_AUTHN`) | Where the RS256 verification keys come from. Empty derives `<URL_AUTHN>/.well-known/jwks.json` — one URL to get wrong, not two. Set only to point at a different authn. |
| `jwt.cacheTTL` | `5m` | How long a fetched key set is served before refresh. Signing keys rotate rarely, so this keeps authn off the hot path of every validation. |
| `jwt.minRefreshInterval` | `30s` | Floor between two JWKS fetches. Throttles the refetch an unrecognised `kid` triggers, so tokens naming a key authn never published cannot become one fetch per request. |
| `jwt.requestTimeout` | `5s` | Per-fetch timeout. Also bounds how long a validation can block, since concurrent cache misses collapse into one fetch. |
| `seedAuthn.*` | group `krateo:snowplow-seed`, namespace `krateo-system`, audience `authn` | The prewarm-seed loopback-auth artifacts (allowlist CR + ClusterRole/Binding + projected token) — **always rendered**; see [usage](./usage.md) for the hard dependency. |
| `extraEnvFrom` | `snowplow-api-override` ConfigMap (optional) | Extra env sources appended after the defaults. |
| `env.*` | see below | Rendered into the `snowplow` ConfigMap. |

## `env.*` — the runtime knobs (chart defaults)

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `CACHE_ENABLED` | `"true"` | The single master cache gate. `false` = transparent fallback to the direct apiserver — same data, same RBAC, slower ([ADR 0004](../go/snowplow/docs/adr/0004-cache-is-provisional-and-removable.md)). |
| `GOMEMLIMIT` | `7GiB` | **Must stay strictly below the container memory limit** (default 8Gi) so Go GC back-pressures before Linux OOM-kills. Move it with `resources.limits.memory`. |
| `GOGC` | `"50"` | Tighter heap for ~1% CPU. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `"warn"` (chart) / `info` (binary) | The single verbosity knob (`--log-level`, #163): `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error`, case-insensitive; an unrecognised value falls back to `info` so a typo never silences logs. |
| `DEBUG` | unset (binary default `"false"`) | **Deprecated** — `main.go` labels `--debug` / `DEBUG` a thin alias for `--log-level=debug`. The chart dropped it in #163; set `LOG_LEVEL` instead. |
| `PRETTY_LOG` | `"false"` | `false` = single-line JSON logs (the pretty handler is a measured CPU/I/O drag in prod). |
| `PHASE1_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `"900"` | Outer backstop for the whole boot warmup (informer sync + prewarm walk + cohort seed). |
| `PHASE1_SYNC_PASS_GRACE_SECONDS` | `"45"` | Per-pass grace for one `WaitForCacheSync` pass. |
| `PHASE1_SYNC_QUIESCENCE_SECONDS` | `"10"` | Registered-set stability window before the sync barrier returns. |
| `CATALOG_UNSERVABLE_TTL_SECONDS` | `"300"` | Short TTL for entries cached while their informer wasn't servable (self-correcting safety net); `0` disables. |
| `UAF_RESOLVED_TTL_SECONDS` | `"300"` | Staleness bound for **restactions-class** entries whose RESTAction declares a `userAccessFilter` stage (#118 (d)); `0` disables. It bounds staleness over *time*, not identity, so it is not a mitigation for a cross-tenant key collision, and it does not stamp the widgets or widgetContent classes. Inert **only while** the A-1 mitigation declines every `userAccessFilter`-bearing cache write; without it this value is live and cuts those cells from 3600s to 300s (a 12x refill rate for the class, boot seed included), so set it to `"0"` for a release that ships without the mitigation. Load-bearing again in 1.13.0 when those writes return under the v7 key. |
| `REFRESH_DROP_EVICT_MAX_PER_MINUTE` | `"64"` | **1.12.6.** Breaker on drop-point evictions: a refresh that fails deterministically across the whole requeue budget (403/500/timeout/parse/not-servable — never a 404, which has its own route) is **evicted** instead of left stale until TTL, up to this many per minute. Over budget the key keeps the pre-1.12.6 drop-to-TTL and one WARN per window names the suspected outage. `"0"` disables drop-point eviction for non-404 failures (1.12.5 behaviour, byte-for-byte). Not a rate limit: it separates "a few dead objects" from "an apiserver outage". |
| `REFRESH_SUPPRESS_AFTER_DECLINES` | `"3"` | **1.12.6.** Consecutive stage-error refresh declines of one key before it is marked refresh-by-traffic-only (no further re-resolves or WARNs until a real `Put` or an eviction clears it — #191). The structurally permanent declines (external endpoint, `userAccessFilter` cell, unsupported kind) suppress on the first occurrence regardless. Minimum `1`. |
| `OTEL_ENABLED` | `"true"` | **1.12.4.** Master switch for OpenTelemetry export to ClickStack (traces + metrics over OTLP/HTTP). `"false"` restores a byte-identical pre-1.12.4 process. Per-signal overrides `OTEL_TRACING_ENABLED` / `OTEL_METRICS_ENABLED` / `OTEL_LOGS_ENABLED` default to the master. Metrics-on is **not free**: the HTTP middleware records three synchronous, unsampled histograms per request (`http.server.request.duration` among them — the first server-side `/call` latency distribution snowplow exports); `OTEL_METRICS_ENABLED: "false"` is the rollback. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `"http://$(HOST_IP):4318"` | The **node-local OTel collector daemonset agent** (hostPort 4318) — the only OTLP ingest on the platform. `$(HOST_IP)` is expanded by the Deployment (downward API), not by the ConfigMap. The collector *deployment* Service also publishes 4317/4318 but has no OTLP receiver: do not point here. |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` | `"traceidratio"` | Sampler **family**. Root-deciding on purpose: snowplow sits behind the agent gateway, whose tracing policy samples 100% and propagates `sampled=1`, so `parentbased_traceidratio` would span 100% of customer `/call`. Trade: 5% complete end-to-end traces + 95% gateway-only traces, partial **by design**. |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` | `"0.05"` | Ratio for the sampler above. The SDK default with no sampler is **100%** — always set together with `OTEL_ENABLED`. Tune only after a Phase-6 measurement at 50K. |
| `OTEL_LOGS_ENABLED` | `"false"` | OTLP log export (audit events). Explicitly off: the collector agent's logs pipeline accepts filelog only, so an OTLP log export has no consumer. Logs stay stdout → filelog; since 1.12.4 every `*Context` record carries a top-level `trace_id` (the OTel id — distinct from the pre-existing `traceId` shortid). |
| `URL_AUTHN` / `URL_SELF` | authn / snowplow in-cluster service URLs | The prewarm-seed loopback-auth pair: exchange the projected SA token at authn, append the JWT only on exact-`URL_SELF` loopback calls. |
| `SERVICEACCOUNT_TOKEN_PATH` | `/var/run/secrets/krateo.io/serviceaccount/token` | Where the projected (audience=`authn`) token is mounted. |
| `JQ_MODULES_PATH` | `/jq-modules` | Custom jq modules, mounted from the chart's `jq-custom-modules` ConfigMap. |
| `BLIZZARD` | `"false"` | Extra-verbose output dump (`main.go` `-blizzard` flag). |

The binary reads more env vars than the chart sets by default (`PORT` — default `8081`;
`AUTHN_NAMESPACE`; the fine-grained cache back-out knobs; the prewarm-engine gates).
Anything the process should see goes in `env.*`; for the full operator view of what
each knob does at scale (sizing, probe philosophy, incident table) read
[operating.md](../go/snowplow/howto/operating.md), and for the per-subsystem semantics
the deep dives under
[`go/snowplow/docs/architecture/`](../go/snowplow/docs/architecture/).

## The CRDs chart

`snowplow-crds` ([`helm/snowplow-crds/`](../helm/snowplow-crds/)) has no configuration:
it installs the `RESTAction` CRD ([api](./api.md)). It is deliberately **not** a
dependency of the app chart, so CRD ownership stays with its own release.
